                            <p> So his laptop is in working condition. However even with extensive cleaning and after removing the various mal-ware it is still crap. I want to factory restore it. I went through start-up to use the factory system restore and it doesn't exist. So I figured I would download a and burn a restore disk on my computer, but his DVD drive is non-responsive. So my question is what other options do I have? I have internet and the laptop is in working condition. Could I possibly download a factory restore. Like the title says, it seems like there's no way of fixing it. BOOTMGR is compressed, I had this issue before and fixed it. By looking up Google I have gotten a ISO of Vista's recovery disk (burned it on a disc of course) and let it start-up, then doing all the other crap from there. Now I promise that after fixing that my computer's been fine for weeks. Later, one day (today) I shut off my computer and then my computer said my copy of Vista wasn't genuine. What? I don't remember. So I've got an Acer desktop that came pre-installed with windows vista on the hard drive. The hard drive stopped working, I replaced the hard-drive and used a windows 7 upgrade disc to install windows 7 onto the new blank hard drive. I tried to validate using both the product keys from the desktop and from the upgrade disc. But because I used an upgrade disc when no pre-existing OS was on the hard drive, it's saying I can't validate. It's saying I have to install vista or fully purchase window. This is going to be pretty long and I'm new at Reddit formatting, so bare with me. I have 2 drives, both from different family members and computers that failed (in a way) and they didn't back up anything, so I'm trying to restore them. I've done all I can think of with prior knowledge and searching Google, but nothing to resolve it yet. I'm trying the recovery on my Windows 7 machine. Drive 1 - 500GB Seagate Barracuda 7200.11 (ST3500620AS) Issue - Family member restarted their. 
I installed cloudready on my old HP windows vista computer. Worked great for the most part, then bought a chromebook. Now I need a windows computer for some things that don't work on chrome (some training modules for work). I tried running the windows vista recovery disk on my old computer but it keeps getting hung up at 49% and wont complete. What options do I have to get some kind of windows or something on my old computer to run some of these training videos that do not work on my chromeboo. So my old HP laptop (G7000) is stuck and even Google won't help me. I'm not able to get into safe mode no matter what I'm doing, it just starts up again and eventually shows the ms corp. loading bar again. I've got a vista recovery disk and am able to boot the pc with it but as soon as windows has loaded all files it shows the loading bar again and won't continue booting up. Somebody Setup my old desktop that came with vista but it was running winows 8 trial/preview from when they were first launching vista, and an ubuntu partition. I set it up yesterday and geforce had a driver update, so I did it. When the computer restarted I launched it into windows 8 and it got to the splash screen, then went black with a loading icon before it went full black and refreshed back to the black screen with the loading icon. It got stuck in this loop endlessly. When I launch into Ubuntu. 
I have this Acer Inspire 5200 laptop I got in Dec 2007, last month it died after a Microsoft software update. I tried rebooting it in safe mode, but it stopped at crsdisk.sys and wouldn't do anything else. I have my windows vista recovery disks so I can just reformat it. But I'm wondering if there is a way to recover my photos. I'm getting a new Dell Inspiron 17R (are those good too?) and I just want all my photos. I saved all of my photos to my documents and also my C drive. If I you the reform. Hey everyone, I used to be pretty tech savvy but having been out of the computer game for a few years I seem to have overestimated my skills. I would really appreciate some help. I apologize for the length but I am trying to include every step I took. A few years ago I had installed an Ubuntu partition on my computer that already had windows vista so I could dual boot it. I wasn't that familiar with Ubuntu with time, so while installing updates I ended up adding about 4 new partitions. This probably isn't solely a linux problem, but you guys are knowledgeable about all this. I have 2 hard drives. 500gb for linux, and a 320gb for windows. Windows worked fine until I installed Ubuntu. Then - under the influence - I tried to repair it. From what I can remember I booted up rescutux and tried probably every option. So now my system boots straight into Ubuntu on boot. When I run fdisk it says there's no partitions on my windows drive? And when I run vista recovery Oh, and it's an HP pavilion. I'm capable of burning vista recovery disks on my DVD-R disks, but if i recall correctly, that had no effect (i may have done it wrong. It was long ago) Would it be viable to burn windows 7 recovery disks and upgrade it from vistas to windows 7 in the process? If not, ill just use vista. I don't plan to re-purchase an OS anyways. If all else fails and it's a total hard-drive failure, would it be possible to. use an eternal harddrive and run an OS off that.?. My Dad's computer had been infected with the Alureon virus, so I had used a boot CD with Windows Defender to remove it. The program reported no problems fixing the issue, but upon restart, the boot sequence halts and Windows does not start up. There were no hardware or BIOS changes made during this time. I tried to use a Vista Recovery disk to see if any system files were damaged, but the drive doesn't even show up as having a Windows install (the drive is still detected in BIOS). Opening comma. My wife has an HP DV9712US that has been having problems recently. It has given many different errors while trying to boot, it gets to BIOS, and then throws them right after. The errors include, in order of frequency: Err1Err3 Operating System Not Found Windows boot manager "status: 0xc00000e9" "info: an unexpected I/O error has occured." Error 0x4001100200001012 the instruction at 0x74bb05ef referenced memory at 0x00000114. the memory could not be read The errors i need some fuckin help. Its 2:30am and this lapptop is driving me crazy. let me start at the begininng. My brother needs excel 2010 on the laptop, but no matter what i tried, whether legal download from his school site, a free trail, or pirated versions, neither of them worked on the laptop. So i decided it was probably not working with the vista on the laptop, so i installed Windows XP on an empty partition on the laptop. Anyway, whenever i restart the laptop, it just boots straight

Does someone My husband has an old computer he would like to give our son to watch movies on. We don't want to buy him a new one because he likes to take things apart and they generally don't go back together the way they are supposed to (he's mildly autistic). The problem is, he has an old HP Pavilion Entertainment PC loaded with Windows Vista Home Premium and has forgotten the password. We do not have a recovery disk for this laptop either. I have tried bypassing and resetting the Administration password. Story time. I posted on here about a month ago explaining how I had bought a computer used from a guy on craigslist. He claimed to have wiped everything and left a clean install of windows on his PC. Well this wasn't true. I went on facebook and the login page had autofilled to this poor seller's account. I went to the firefox privacy settings and looked at saved passwords and saw that ALL HIS USERNAMES AND PASSWORDS WERE SAVED. Like, every one, ebay, amazon, bank accounts, professional accoun. I trying to run a recovered system image of a vista machine as a vm in virtual box. When I try to boot it's keeps blue screening and I need to get into the bios. I've tried every option in the safe boot menu with no luck. Does anyone know how to get into the bios? Not safe mode. Thanks. 
Trying to clean reinstall Vista on an HP. What do I do about the Disk 0 Partition 2 RECOVERY? It is 14.6GB with 5GB free. Should I just ignore it? I formatted the primary disk so it is basically free (581.4/581.5GB). Should I just select this and move on, or do I need to format the recovery portion too? Thank you for your help. This is the step I am on by the way but with a different screen: http://www.theeldergeek.com/vista/images/Vista%20Clean%20Installation/Vista%20Final%20-0032.jpg. Normally I'm a firm believer in the idea that any computer problem can be solved with the help of google, but I'm rather drawing a blank here. I've got an old vista pc that I'm trying to repair. It still boots normally, but randomly BSODs on me, runs very slowly. I downloaded a vista repair disk ISO from here ( burnt it on to a CD, and put it in the CD drive. Didn't need to change the boot order, it booted perfectly I'm desperate for help here, I have a dell inspiron 530 with a Radeon HD 2600 gfx card installed. The computer failed to boot after the loading Microsoft bar showed up, giving me a blue screen. I've tried to use the packaged recovery disk but it too gave me a blue screen after the loading bar showed up. I've tried formatting the hdd and install windows 7 but it fails to load after the disks boots; showing me my mouse and nothing else. The only thing that has worked for me was a clean install. I bought a used hp g72 227wm laptop for my parents. I saw it turn on and got to desktop screen and thought it was fine. I didnt notice that it was Vista because I've never used vista. It also has random Sony Vaio software. The guy probably put in a random HDD from a sony vaio with Vista into this HP laptop that should have Windows 7. I am extremely exhausted and frusterated. What can I possibly do to get this thing running for my parents without having to end up homeless at this point Edit:.
